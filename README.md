# capstone_project: Multi-Objective Optimization Problem on the example of buying a car.

In my Capstone Progect at General Assembly I used Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to solve multiobjective problem.

Problem statement:
Let's assume that someone is planning to buy Toyota Corolla. He or she goes to a website (I picked www.carsales.com.au) to check avaliable cars. There are about 4000 unique Toyota Corolla cars around the whole Australia. The most important features are price, age and odometer (our objectives). 

Let's have a look at those three as an example:

It is unclear which one is the best deal. Because a buyer wants the chipest car with the least odometer and the newest one at the same time. This simple problem is the example multi-objective optimization problem and finding non-dominated solutions.

For this particular case it is required to minimize all the objectives. So pareto-frontier will look like this (in 2D case):
